I chose MIS as a major because technology is so integral to society at many levels that it is impossible to ignore the values it holds in the world today. Before college, I did not know about the existence of the MIS major, so I went on to finish my general core classes. As time went on, I have been eyeing in on MIS because all the applications we use on computers, such as web browsers, are coded. And I am curious about how the code works. So I took the opportunity to major in MIS and decided to open up to the idea of learning more about the technological side involving computer languages and put myself here in ITM 352.
