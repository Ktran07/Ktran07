WOD 5.1 aimed to make the html file cleaner and better organized by utilizing javascript to remove some of the hard coding texts and images of the html file and instead place those codes onto the javascript file within the same directory. 

WOD 5.1 details: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html

This WOD was straightforward since I only had to declare variables for the texts and images, and I transferred those codes to the newly created javascript file. In the final step, I linked my html file to the javascript file, where I was able to reduce the length of my code in the html file by taking off the hard coding texts and images out of the html file.

In preparation for this WOD, I read through the instructions and tried to understand what the instructions want me to do at each stage and how they build up to the final product. Compared to past WOD, I think this WOD was easier based on the detailed instructions on what to look for within the different sections of the code. What I might try differently in the next WOD is to pay more attention to details where I have left over some code that should have been deleted but did not, and it took me extra time to locate and remove the leftover parts.
